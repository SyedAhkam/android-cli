# Installation

## Using cargo

### From crates.io

```sh
$ cargo install android-cli
```

### From git directly (latest changes, may be unstable)

```sh
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/SyedAhkam/android-cli.git
```

## Using github releases

Haven't set this up yet. Coming soon.

## From source

Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed (with Cargo). Then, clone the repository and run the following command from the root of the repository:

```sh
$ cargo install --path .
```


> After installation, you should have access to the `android` binary from your choice of shell.
